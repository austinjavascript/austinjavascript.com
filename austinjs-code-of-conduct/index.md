## The Quick Version

Our meetup is dedicated to providing a harassment-free meetup experience for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of meetup participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any meetup venue, including talks, workshops, parties, Twitter and other online media. Meetup participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the meetup *without a refund* at the discretion of the meetup organizers.

## The Less Quick Version

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualized images, activities, or other material.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the meetup organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the meetup.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact an organizer immediately.

Organizers will be happy to help participants contact venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the meetup. We value your attendance.

We expect participants to follow these rules at the meetup itself as well as meetup-related social events.
