## What is this?

Austin JavaScript is a community that meets to discuss JavaScript and the open web. The group started back in 2009, and it's been going strong ever since. We cover a range of topics, including:

- The JavaScript language
- New features of the web platform
- JavaScript app frameworks
- Frontend ops
- Testing your code
- Running JavaScript in native apps
- Running JavaScript on the server
- Running JavaScript on other peoples sites
- Cryptography
- How CSS colors got their names

If you'd like to get more details on the topcs, take a look at the [post archives][].

## How does it usually work?

We typically meet on the 3<sup>rd</sup> Tuesday of each month downtown. We'll have a speaker or two, open things up for questions and discussion, and then head over to [Lavaca Street Bar][] to continue the festivities.

## Anything else I should know?

Yes! We've work hard to build a community of people that treats eachother with *excellence*. We've formalized what this means into [our Code of Conduct][].

## Who are these people?

Austin JavaScript is made possible by the hard work and good will of many people, but there are a few in particular that you should feel free to reach out to if you've got any questions:
