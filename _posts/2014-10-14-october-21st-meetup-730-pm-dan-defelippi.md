We&#8217;ve got another `~*super rad*~` meetup next Tuesday, October 21<sup>st</sup>. Local favorite [Dan DeFelippi][1] ([@expertdan][2]) is going to educate us on building mobile apps with [Cordova][3] (the open-source engine behind [PhoneGap][4]). Aside from being a proper geek and hacker, Dan is a co-founder of local bike rental and bike share app [Spokefly][5].

Many thanks to the good folks at [Frog][6] for hosting us again. And thank you, [Bazaar Voice][7], for covering the drinks and pizza. If you&#8217;re looking for a job or just want to express your deep-seated love and appreciation for anyone kind enough to give you pizza, talk to one of the folks in a BV t-shirt or [reach out online][8].

  * When: Tuesday, October 21<sup>st</sup>, 2014 from 7:30-9:00 PM.
  * Where: Frog Design – 101 West 6<sup>th</sup> Street – 2<sup>nd</sup> Floor
  * How: Parking is on the street, or you can bus, bike, rollerblade, segway, or walk yourself down there and just not worry about it.
  * Drinks and pizza will be provided.

Afterwards, the discussion carries on a few blocks away at [The Gingerman][9], where they have over 70 beers on tap. 

If you&#8217;ve got any questions or suggestions, feel free to contact Aaron ([@aaronj1335][10]).  Also, be sure to follow us on Twitter: [@AustinJS][11]
