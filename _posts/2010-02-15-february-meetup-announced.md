### JavaScript Quiz and HandlebarJS

#### Speaker:  YOU!

Yes, that&#8217;s right, you will be participating, okay, only if you want to, but it is highly encouraged.

#### Talk:  JavaScript Quiz

Recently, Juriy Zaytsev, otherwise known as &#8220;kangax&#8221; and core developer for Prototype, released a quiz with some rather challenging questions related to some of the unique underpinnings and nuances of the JavaScript language.

We will take the quiz, collectively, and even go through the answers, collectively!  Group participation is key here as the more people contribute, the more people learn.

#### Speaker:  Kyle Simpson

Kyle Simpson is a UI architect from Austin, TX. He is passionate about user experience, specifically optimizing the UI to be as responsive, efficient, secure, and scalable as possible. He considers JavaScript the ultimate language and is constantly tinkering with how to push it further. If something can&#8217;t be done in JavaScript or web technology, he&#8217;s bored by it. He has a number of open-source projects, including flXHR, LABjs, mpAjax, and jXHR, and he also is a core contributor to SWFObject. Kyle can be found talking about JavaScript on Twitter @getify and @AustinJS.

#### Talk:  JavaScript instance operators, HandlebarJS Templating

We&#8217;ll continue the discussions from the JavaScript quizzes and zero in on a few powerful but often-confused JavaScript operators: new, delete, and instanceof. To illustrate the use of these operators, we&#8217;ll look at a pattern for custom error handling.

Armed with a new found confidence in some of JavaScript&#8217;s nitty gritty details, we&#8217;ll take a look at a new templating engine (HandlebarJS) which can run either browser-side or server-side. Coverage will include both the templating syntax as well as a code review of the engine&#8217;s internals.

#### Sponsor:  [WhoLinksToMe][1]

We will have free pizza from Home Slice (they are now open on Tuesdays) along with some soft drinks and possibly some beer, all courtesy of our sponsor, WhoLinksToMe!

  * When:  Tuesday, February 16th, 2010 from  7:30-9:30 PM.
  * Where:  [Virtue Group][2] &#8211;  [1206 W 43rd Street Austin TX 78756][3]
  * How:  Parking is on the street, or you can take the #3 bus or #338 bus.

Afterwards, the discussion carries on one block away at [The Draught House][4], where it just happens to be pint night so you can get your beer fix here.

Any questions or suggestions, please feel free to contact Joe ([@joemccann][5]) or Kyle ([@getify][6]).  Also, official group on twitter: [@AustinJS][7]
