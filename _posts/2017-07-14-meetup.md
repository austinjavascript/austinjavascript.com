It's too hot for hair out there, so we've asked Lon Ingram to come talk to us
about making websites fast as &#9889; (kung fu fighting, etc). Join us
Tuesday <x-date>{{ site.categories.meetups[0].when | date_to_xmlschema }}</x-date> and
learn what it takes to appease our search engine overlords!

### Talk summary

With the rise of the mobile web, speed has become crucial to success. Users
won't wait around for slow-loading pages and search engines are now punishing
sluggish sites. There's a wealth of ideas out there for cranking up
performance, but how do you know where to start? What if you work for days to
ship an optimization that doesn't really pay off? In this talk, you'll learn
how to experiment and fail fast. You'll find out how to quickly and rigorously
assess your optimization ideas with open source tools, and how to share your
results so that others can replicate your findings.
