We hope your summers were eventful and full of fun, but it's time to get back into the groove. We're happy to partner up with the [EmberATX meetup][1] for a meetup of the centuries. [Tom Dale][2], co-creator of [Ember.js][3] will be visiting Austin to give a talk about Ember.js, the state of Ember 1.0, and the future of the framework.

We're expecting a pretty full-house and only have limited space, **so we ask that you RSVP here: [Meetup.com EmberATX/AustinJS RSVP][4]** (slackers note: it should be open up 'til the moment the meetup starts, unless it fills up).

AustinJS would like to thank the [@EmberATX][8] community for setting this up. We're happy to share our space with other awesome JavaScript communities in town!
