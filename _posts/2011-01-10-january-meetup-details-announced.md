After a nice break and great happy hour sponsored by [Tek Systems][1] over December, Austin JavaScript is back in action with a great talk by the local node.js and JavaScript gaming phenom, Bradley Meck.

Bradley is a [Node.js][2] user and has implemented es-harmony objects as a v8 extension. Runtime compilation and optimization are some of his passions along with his firm belief in JavaScript being a misunderstood language, even by many developers (including himself).

JavaScript gaming is becoming an even hotter topic as many game developers are moving away from Flash and more towards and &#8220;HTML5&#8243; framework for implementing games.  Bradley will be discussing the state of game creation in Javascript, some problems and solutions for developers wanting to create games and finally how to interact with Flash in order to obtain some valuable fallbacks. His presentation will also touch on some of the roadblocks and issues with multi-player games.

Of course we will followup his presentation with our wildly crowd-pleasing roundtable of JavaScript-related questions.  This is an open forum to present topics of discussion in a rapid-fire manner or simply heckle [@joemccann][3].

  * When: Tuesday, January 18th, 2011 from 7:30-9:00 PM.
  * Where: frog design – 101 West 6th Street – 2nd Floor
  * How: Parking is on the street, or you can take any number of buses to get downtown.
  * Drinks and pizza will be provided.

Afterwards, the discussion carries on a few blocks away at [The Gingerman][4], where they have over 70 beers on tap.

Any questions or suggestions, please feel free to contact Joe ([@joemccann][5]).  Also, be sure to follow us on Twitter: [@AustinJS][6]
