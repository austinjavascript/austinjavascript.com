List manipulation is a foundation of programming, and filtering is one of the pillars. Use cases are widespread, from removing outliers from a dataset to applying filters from user interactions. When a list of criteria gets large, however, the code used for these filters can get unruly.

By using and writing higher-order functions, you can write, combine, and manipulate criteria while keeping your JavaScript readable, maintainable, and DRY.
