This month&#8217;s Austin JS meetup not only taps into our extensive local talent base, but brings in the academic side of JavaScript as well.  Local JavaScript aficionado, [Lon Ingram][1], will be discussing his University of Texas Honors Thesis, Treehouse.  This is an event not to be missed!

Now finished with school, Lon is focusing on being the lead Lead Frontend Engineer for [Waterfall Mobile][2]. He&#8217;s been working with JavaScript for over six years and specializes in complex single-page web applications.

Lon will be presenting TreeHouse, the subject of his honors thesis, which he completed under the supervision of Dr. Michael Walfish. TreeHouse is a system that uses Web Workers to sandbox (mostly) unmodified JavaScript. TreeHouse gives application authors fine-grained control over untrusted code in their application. Authors can control what parts of the DOM untrusted code can see and modify, as well as the API calls it can make.  Is your mind blown yet?

Of course we will followup all of this up with our wildly crowd-pleasing roundtable of JavaScript-related questions.  This is an open forum to present topics of discussion in a rapid-fire manner or simply heckle [@joemccann][3].

  * When: Tuesday, May 15th, 2012 from 7:30-9:00 PM.
  * Where: frog design – 101 West 6th Street – 2nd Floor
  * How: Parking is on the street, or you can take any number of buses to get downtown.
  * Drinks and pizza will be provided.

Afterwards, the discussion carries on a few blocks away at [The Gingerman][4], where they have over 70 beers on tap.

Any questions or suggestions, please feel free to contact Joe ([@joemccann][5]).  Also, be sure to follow us on Twitter: [@AustinJS][6].
