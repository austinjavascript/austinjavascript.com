Whatup jorbascrupmers. As promised we&#8217;re going to be hearing about a shiny new feature coming in the next version of JavaScript &mdash; generators.

[Jonathan Lipps][1] will give a talk titled *Yield! How ES6 Generators and Monocle-js Can Bring Async Into Line, Literally*, and will teach us how generators can save our souls from callback hell.

Jonathan has been making things out of code as long as he can remember. He currently works as Director of Ecosystem and Integrations at Sauce Labs, leading a team of open source developers to improve the web and mobile testing ecosystem. Jonathan is the architect and project lead for Appium, the open-source, cross-platform mobile automation framework (written in Node). He has worked as a programmer in tech startups for over a decade, but is also passionate about academic discussion.

We&#8217;ve got a lot of good folks to thank this month. Thanks to [Sauce Labs][2] for flying Jonathan out to do the talk. As always, thanks to [Frog][3] for hosting us. And last but not least thanks to our main sponsor, [Joust][4], for drinks and food. Joust is a startup with a lot of momentum and several major customers like ESPN, ABC, and MTV. They&#8217;re building a core team of engineers, so if you&#8217;re interested, contact [Philip][5].
