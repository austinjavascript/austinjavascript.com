After 14 solid months of usage at [Virtue Group&#8217;s][1] stunning office, we are moving our location to the crossroads of downtown Austin, namely 6th and Congress. The new meeting location will be at [frog design&#8217;s][2] Austin studio located at [101 West 6th Street, 2nd Floor][3] of the historical [Scarborough Building][4].

Meeting will start *promptly* at 7:30 PM and will be wrapping up at 9pm. Afterwards, the conversations carry on the [Gingerman][5], only 3 blocks away.
