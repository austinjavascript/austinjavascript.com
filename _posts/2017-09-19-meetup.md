Source maps, huh, yeah. What are they good for? Absolutely... some things.

We have an extra special treat this month thanks to our gracious hosts and good
friends at [Spredfast][]: <a href="{{ speakurl }}">{{ speakr }}</a> is coming
all the way from "San Francisco" to tell us everything about how source maps
work. Join us Tuesday <x-date>{{ site.categories.meetups[0].when | date_to_xmlschema }}</x-date> for a special Bae Area AustinJS!

<h3>Talk summary</h3>

You may already be familiar with source maps. They let you debug your original,
unminified, and untranspiled code in the browser. But have you ever wondered how
they actually work? Ben will take a deep dive into the source map format to see
whatâ€™s under the hood, exploring source map generation tools, parsers, and how
to manipulate source maps directly for fun and profit.

Not only did [Spredfast][] fly Ben out, but they are providing food and drink,
so be sure to tell them thanks!
