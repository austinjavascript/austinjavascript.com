That time of year is here again, where we in the Austin JavaScript community close our laptops and instead have a few beers together. After such a successful event last year at [Kung Fu Saloon][1], we decided to do the same thing this year, but with more reasons to come out and support the community.

First, this year, we will be requiring attendees to either have an official SXSW badge or two cans of food to donate to the [Capital Area Food Bank][2]. With such a huge turnout last year, why wouldn&#8217;t we use this as an opportunity to raise awareness and help stamp out hunger in the greater Austin area. A party with a cause! Party details are as follows:

  * Sunday, March 13, 2011 4pm to 8pm
  * Kung Fu Saloon &#8211; [510 Rio Grande, Austin TX 78701][3]
  * Free Texas Beer
  * Free Authentic Tex-Mex Tacos courtesy of [Maudie&#8217;s][4]
  * Free Gaming at Kung Fu Saloon including Skeeball and all Vintage Arcade Games
  * Free No Strings-Attached Door Prize Giveaways Every Hour (iPad, Android Tablet, Amazon Kindle, VIP Tickets to Microsoft&#8217;s ACL Party, a ticket to [TXJS][5] and possibly more)
  * Free Swag Bags to Take Home full of Goodies

Of course none of this would be possible without the unwavering support of our gracious sponsors: [Microsoft (IE Team)][6], [Solvate][7], [Mozilla (Developer Engagement)][8], [TekSystems][9] and [Cultivate PR][10].

Microsoft will actually be out engaging and entertaining all who attend to check out the latest version of IE9 and to assist developers preparing their sites and apps *now*.  You do know that [IE9 is at release candidate state][11], right?

Stay tuned as even more details are announced.  We have a few tricks up our sleeve&#8230;
