Happy New Year everyone! Here's to fresh start. We're kicking the year off in
style with a great talk from <a href="{{ speakurl }}">{{ speakr }}</a>!

Rachel will share a selection of personal projects that bring vintage
electronics into the 21<sup>st</sup> century with Node.js and hobbyist
microcontrollers.  She’ll also cover some of the basic tools and approaches to
getting started with refurbishing, refitting, and reworking old game consoles,
computers, and digital toys.
