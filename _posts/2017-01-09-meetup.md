Happy New Year everyone! Here's to fresh start. We're kicking the year off in
style with a great talk from <a href="{{ speakurl }}">{{ speakr }}</a>!

Rachel will share a selection of personal projects that bring vintage
electronics into the 21<sup>st</sup> century with Node.js and hobbyist
microcontrollers.  Sheâ€™ll also cover some of the basic tools and approaches to
getting started with refurbishing, refitting, and reworking old game consoles,
computers, and digital toys.
