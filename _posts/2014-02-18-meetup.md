This month we&#8217;ll be hearing from [Garann Means][1] about refactoring big apps!

It would be nice if developers could download a JavaScript framework, plug in the custom logic required for their particular problem, and have a functional, scalable, and reliable application. As any who&#8217;s tried can probably tell you, however, it doesn&#8217;t work like that. It doesn&#8217;t matter if your application has 5000 &#8220;pages&#8221; or less than 50 &#8211; it will eventually become a large application in terms of code, because size of code is not just a measure of the complexity of the app itself, but of its maturity. If you&#8217;ve tried taking an app from a minimal set of functionality to something complex enough to cover all the edge cases, you&#8217;ve probably done some rewriting.

If you haven&#8217;t, it&#8217;s your lucky day! We&#8217;ll talk about several of the ways you can almost guarantee a rewrite in your app&#8217;s future. If, on the other hand, rewrites don&#8217;t sound like that much fun to you, we&#8217;ll also talk about how to avoid them or at least minimise the risk they present
