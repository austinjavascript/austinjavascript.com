Following up on last month&#8217;s stellar presentation by [Nodejitsu][1]&#8216;s, co-founder and CTO, [Paolo Fragemeni][2], Austin JavaScript is back in February with another mover and shaker in the JavaScript and Mobile development industry, [Rebecca Murphey][3].

Rebecca is the lead JavaScript developer at [Toura][4] and the lead architect of [Mulberry][5], Toura&#8217;s open-source mobile development framework. She&#8217;s also a co-founder of the epic [TXJS][6] and the author of [jQuery Fundamentals][7]. On top of all of that, Rebecca speaks and writes frequently about patterns for organizing large JavaScript applications.

Rebecca will be introducing us to Toura&#8217;s Mulberry, which is an open-source, cross-platform mobile application development framework built on top of [PhoneGap][8] that lets you use web technologies to produce engaging, content-rich applications. In this talk, Rebecca will give a quick demo of Mulberry basics, then dive in to how they architected the JavaScript, templates, CSS, and tests to create a flexible, pluggable, 100% client-side content publishing system. DON&#8217;T SLEEP ON THIS!

Of course we will followup all of this up with our wildly crowd-pleasing roundtable of JavaScript-related questions.  This is an open forum to present topics of discussion in a rapid-fire manner or simply heckle [@joemccann][9].

Finally, we will be throwing the **3rd Annual Austin JS SXSW Party** in March so if you and/or your employer/company would like to sponsor the event (or be a part of it), please reach out to [@joemccann][9] to find out more details.

  * When: Tuesday, February 21st, 2012 from 7:30-9:00 PM.
  * Where: frog design – 101 West 6th Street – 2nd Floor
  * How: Parking is on the street, or you can take any number of buses to get downtown.
  * Drinks and pizza will be provided.

Afterwards, the discussion carries on a few blocks away at [The Gingerman][10], where they have over 70 beers on tap.

Any questions or suggestions, please feel free to contact Joe ([@joemccann][11]).  Also, be sure to follow us on Twitter: [@AustinJS][12].
