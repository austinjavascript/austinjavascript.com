We&#8217;re back with another AustinJS! We&#8217;ll be hearing a couple of talks again this month. First up, Steve Stedman ([@stedman][1]) will be doling out some knowledge on [LESS][2], a popular CSS preprocessor implemented in Javascript. Next Alex Sexton ([@SlexAxton][3]) will teach us about X11 colors (wha?!!??) and how they&#8217;ve impacted the web.
