September's meetup welcome's back local node.js hacker, Bradley Meck but this time Bradley is bringing his partner in crime, Kassandra Perch, to talk about not only a buzzword-worthy topic, but also one a topic that is incredibly useful &#8211; offline web apps.

Offline features are more than just for when you application is offline or for viewing content offline! Bradley and Kassandra will be discussing how to use ApplicationCache to speed up page loads and Lawnchair.js for storing offline data. They will have an example using Backbone.js' ORM to have an offline application send requests with updated data to a server after it has been offline w/o user interaction.

Of course we will followup all of this up with our wildly crowd-pleasing roundtable of JavaScript-related questions. This is an open forum to present topics of discussion in a rapid-fire manner.

[Joe][1] and [Alex][2] will be both be attending [Funconf][3] so local Git, Python and JavaScript master, [Travis Swicegood][4] will be guest hosting the meetup.
