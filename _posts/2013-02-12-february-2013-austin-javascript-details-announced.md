February has enough days dedicated to love and romance, so we&#8217;re dedicating our meetup to **bugs**. We&#8217;ve got local JavaScript free-thinker and theorist Lon Ingram joining us for a talk about bugs and bug reproduction (ewww gross).

**Lon Ingram** is lead frontend engineer at Waterfall Mobile. He&#8217;s been writing JavaScript for a living for over six years, and working exclusively on single-page apps for the last three. His personal and academic projects focus on the problem of building complex apps on the web stack, with a particular interest in applying results from systems research.

#### Topic

> I will discuss the problem of reproducing and diagnosing bugs reported from the wild, and then present Reanimator, an experimental system for capturing and replaying JavaScript applications. Reanimator captures non-deterministic input to a JavaScript application in a log that can replayed at a later date. It was originally designed for recording web application crashes for later debugging, but I will also cover other uses, such as usability testing and tutorials.

Of course we will followup all of this up with our wildly crowd-pleasing roundtable of JavaScript-related questions.  This is an open forum to present topics of discussion in a rapid-fire manner or simply heckle [@joemccann][1] or [@slexaxton][2]!

  * When: Tuesday, February 19th, 2013 from 7:30-9:00 PM.
  * Where: frog design – 101 West 6th Street – 2nd Floor
  * How: Parking is on the street, or you can take any number of buses to get downtown.
  * Drinks and pizza will be provided.

Afterwards, the discussion carries on a few blocks away at [The Gingerman][3], where they have over 70 beers on tap.

Thanks to our sponsor IBM. They&#8217;re hiring developers! Check out the [job description][4] and contact Jill (jorlich@us.ibm.com) to apply.
