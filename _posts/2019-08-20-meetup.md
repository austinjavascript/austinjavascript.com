One of the first things we learn in JavaScript is `console.log()`. Yet this belies the true
complexity of its behavior. What exactly does `console.log()` do, anyways? (The short answer: it
depends!) Adorn your pith and get in the jeep because we're about to explore `console.log()` and
maybe learn a few things about streams, browsers and JavaScript engines along the way!
