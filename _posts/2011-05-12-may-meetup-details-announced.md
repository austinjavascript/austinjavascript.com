On the heels of the epic conference week that was [JSConf ][1]and [Nodeconf][2], the Austin JS meetup is finally set for the the month of May.  We will be going over some of the highlights of JSConf and local JavaScript hacker and semi-pro [videographer][3], [Alex Sexton][4], will be giving a talk on what to expect out of [Modernizr 2.0][5].  We will also be giving away a ticket to [TXJS][6].  Seriously.

Alex is a Labs Engineer at [Bazaarvoice ][7]here in Austin. He created the [yepnope.js][8] library and is on the [Modernizr ][9]team and a couple fake/nonvoting/volunteer jQuery subteams that deal with bug triage and docs. He is running [TXJS ][10]2011 on June 11.  He also has a [website][11].

Modernizr was one of the first libraries on the scene in the &#8216;new-world feature testing religion.&#8217; Modernizr 2 is just around the corner and there are some nifty new features in there to help you build modern web apps. Some time would and will be well spent going into how to use Modernizr, but there will also be some more in depth looks into the internals of the core library, build tool, Modernizr.load and into how to extend all of these things for great good. HTML5 today. Straight up.

Did we mention we are giving away a ticket to [TXJS][10]?  It&#8217;s sold out, btw.

Of course we will followup all of this up with our wildly crowd-pleasing roundtable of JavaScript-related questions.  This is an open forum to present topics of discussion in a rapid-fire manner or simply heckle [@joemccann][12].

  * When: Tuesday, May 17th, 2011 from 7:30-9:00 PM.
  * Where: frog design – 101 West 6th Street – 2nd Floor
  * How: Parking is on the street, or you can take any number of buses to get downtown.
  * Drinks and pizza will be provided.

Afterwards, the discussion carries on a few blocks away at [The Gingerman][13], where they have over 70 beers on tap.

Any questions or suggestions, please feel free to contact Joe ([@joemccann][14]).  Also, be sure to follow us on Twitter: [@AustinJS][15]
