[Appcelerator][1], the company behind the awesome mobile app development framework [Titanium][2], has been a long time supporter of Austin JS going back many years.  This month, we are treated to a special presentation (no, NOT a product pitch) by one of their key (and local!) developers, [Bert Granges][3], to talk about and show off the latest and greatest that Titanium has to offer.

Bert Grantges has been in software development for over 12 years working from client side driver development (eww!) to enterprise web apps, as well as mobile applications releasing successful games for iOS. Proffessionally– he has worked primarily in Telecom and Support Automation space, but has recently left the dark side to jump both feet into a more socially conscious Mobile platform space and is loving it. He has over 5 years of mobile development experience, both in pure native as well as Appcelerator Titanium. Un-Proffesionally – he continues to develop mobile applications, climb mountains, and crusade on behalf of bat conservation.

Ever wonder what it would be like to use JavaScript to build native applications for iOS and Android? Wouldn&#8217;t it be nice if you could use one codebase for both platforms?  Using JavaScript, Appcelerator Titanium platform and Cloud Services, you&#8217;ll walk through what it takes to build out a fully functional mobile application supported by backend services. Along the way you will learn how Appcelerator Titanium works and hopefully learn a bit about JavaScript along the way.

Of course we will followup all of this up with our wildly crowd-pleasing roundtable of JavaScript-related questions.  This is an open forum to present topics of discussion in a rapid-fire manner or simply heckle [@joemccann][4].

  * When: Tuesday, September 18th, 2012 from 7:30-9:00 PM.
  * Where: frog design – 101 West 6th Street – 2nd Floor
  * How: Parking is on the street, or you can take any number of buses to get downtown.
  * Drinks and awesome pizza from [Home Slice][5] will be provided.

Afterwards, the discussion carries on a few blocks away at [The Gingerman][6], where they have over 70 beers on tap.  **We may even have some free rounds of beer courtesy of our awesome sponsors**.

Any questions or suggestions, please feel free to contact Joe ([@joemccann][7]).  Also, be sure to follow us on Twitter: [@AustinJS][8].
