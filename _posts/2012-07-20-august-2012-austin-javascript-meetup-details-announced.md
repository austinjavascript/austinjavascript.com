After last month&#8217;s huge turnout for the meetup we are expecting yet another large turnout for local software developer and JavaScript aficionado, [David Tulig][1].

David is a software engineer at [Indeed.com][2]. He has spent a majority of his time at Indeed helping to improve the front-end of Indeed’s products. His recent projects have included building Indeed’s resume editor and helping build and architect the resume search web application.

David&#8217;s talk will start by going over the components of the Google Closure Tools. This will cover the templates, which are usable on both the client and server, the library, which comes with a dependency management system and a large set of utilities, and the compiler, which performs advanced optimizations to speed up your JavaScript and reduce the size of the final application. He&#8217;ll then go into detail on how Indeed has leveraged those tools to build resume instant search, covering using the closure tools in development, discussing the architecture that drives the product, and the advantages gained by using the closure tools.

Of course we will followup all of this up with our wildly crowd-pleasing roundtable of JavaScript-related questions.  This is an open forum to present topics of discussion in a rapid-fire manner or simply heckle [@joemccann][3].

  * When: Tuesday, August 21st, 2012 from 7:30-9:00 PM.
  * Where: frog design – 101 West 6th Street – 2nd Floor
  * How: Parking is on the street, or you can take any number of buses to get downtown.
  * Drinks and awesome pizza from [Home Slice][4] will be provided.

Afterwards, the discussion carries on a few blocks away at [The Gingerman][5], where they have over 70 beers on tap.  **We may even have some free rounds of beer courtesy of our awesome sponsors**.

Any questions or suggestions, please feel free to contact Joe ([@joemccann][6]).  Also, be sure to follow us on Twitter: [@AustinJS][7].
