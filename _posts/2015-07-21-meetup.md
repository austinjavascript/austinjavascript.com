We're really fortunate to have such a great space to meet downtown, so thank you

If you have a drink or slice of pizza this month, make sure to say thanks to
our sponsors, [Advisory Board][]. Even better, if you're looking for job with a
great team here in Austin, talk to one of their folks about open positions!
