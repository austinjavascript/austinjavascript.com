We&#8217;re back with another AustinJS! We&#8217;ll be hearing a couple of talks again this month. First up, Steve Stedman ([@stedman][1]) will be doling out some knowledge on [LESS][2], a popular CSS preprocessor implemented in Javascript. Next Alex Sexton ([@SlexAxton][3]) will teach us about X11 colors (wha?!!??) and how they&#8217;ve impacted the web.

Our sponsor this month is [Hudl][4]. Come tell them thanks for buying the pizza and drinks, and if you happen to be looking for a job, let them know in person or checkout their [open positions][5]!
