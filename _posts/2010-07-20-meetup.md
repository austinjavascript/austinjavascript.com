The July meetup details consist of some client side and server side JavaScript discussions. Joe McCann will be providing some info on the ultra hot web server and web app framework Node.js while Andrew Dupont educates us on the latest and greatest features of scripty2.

## Introducing Node.js

Joe will be introducing [Node.js][3], an [evented][4] [I/O][5] [framework][6] for the [V8 JavaScript engine][7].  Node.js is intended to be used to write scalable network programs such as web servers.  However, Node can also be used as a web app framework in addition to its use as a web server.  Joe will be showing some very high level uses of Node (Hello World), but also some more practical uses including the use of the [Express framework][8] and even an example of using [WebSockets][9] with Node.

## Scripty — Successor to script.aculo.us

The long alpha period of [scripty2][11], the successor to [script.aculo.us][12], is nearing a close. Andrew will give a tour of the new scripty2 effects engine — complete with support for CSS transitions and hardware-accelerated animation — and show you the new UI components which boast full compatibility with jQuery UI themes.
