It&#8217;s June. It&#8217;s getting hot and we all need a little more JavaScript in our lives. Well, enjoy the air conditioned comfort of Austin JS on June 18th with a talk from JavaScript SuperStar Rebecca Murphey.

**[Rebecca Murphey][1]** is a JavaScript application developer and a frequent speaker on the topic of code organization and best practices at events around the world. She authored the learning site [jQuery Fundamentals][2], contributed to the [jQuery Cookbook][3] from O’Reilly Media, served as a technical reviewer for David Herman’s [Effective JavaScript][4], and created the [TXJS][5] conference. She has also created and contributed to several open-source projects. She was instrumental in getting [deferreds and promises][6] introduced to jQuery 1.5; she created the [js-assessment][7] project, a test-driven tool for assessing a developer’s JavaScript skills; and she contributed key modules to the [Johnny Five][8] library for using JavaScript to interact with Arduinos.

#### Topic: Writing Testable JavaScript

It&#8217;s one thing to write the code you need to write to get something working; it&#8217;s another thing to write the code you need to write if you want to be able to prove that it works &#8212; and that it keeps working as you refactor and add new features. In this talk, we&#8217;ll look at what it means to write testable JavaScript code.

Of course we will followup all of this up with our wildly crowd-pleasing roundtable of JavaScript-related questions.  This is an open forum to present topics of discussion in a rapid-fire manner or simply heckle [@slexaxton][9]!

This month&#8217;s awesome sponsor is the [XO Group, Inc][10]. Be sure to thank them for the drinks and pizza, or talk to them about some [job opportunities][11]! You can also email [Shaun][12] if you are interested in working there.

[![XO Group][13]][11] 

  * When: Tuesday, June 18th, 2013 from 7:30-9:00 PM.
  * Where: Frog Design – 101 West 6th Street – 2nd Floor
  * How: Parking is on the street, or you can take any number of buses to get downtown.
  * Drinks and pizza will be provided.

Afterwards, the discussion carries on a few blocks away at [The Gingerman][14], where they have over 70 beers on tap.
