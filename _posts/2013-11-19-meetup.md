Glad tidings, Austin JavaScripters, we bring you good news of our meetup this month! We&#8217;re happy to welcome Kassandra Perch to throw down some knowledge on Twitter&#8217;s framework, [Flight][1].

Her talk is titled &#8220;Flight: a Framework done right,” and we&#8217;ll talk about how the framework is event-driven, component-based, and leverages the DOM to form a cohesive code structure. The concept of functional mixins will also be introduced, and how it is unique from other forms of class composition. Finally, we&#8217;ll cover how all of these create a testable, scalable, friendly front-end code base.
