Wrapping up the amazing conference that was [TXJS][1], this month TXJS frontman, [Alex Sexton][2] will be hosting June&#8217;s meetup. We also have Austin local via Chicago, [Tim Tyrrell][3] chatting up [Jasmine][4], the uber-cool JavaScript unit testing framework.

*Test-Driving Javascript with Jasmine* &#8211; There seems to be a tendency for developers to do an excellent job of unit testing their server-side code but leaving client-side javascript as the new “spaghetti” dumping ground and it doesn’t have to be that way! Jasmine is a nifty Javascript BDD testing framework with a RSpec-like syntax that easily integrates with vanilla JavaScript, jQuery plugins, and even Rails applications.

Of course we will followup all of this up with our wildly crowd-pleasing roundtable of JavaScript-related questions. This is an open forum to present topics of discussion in a rapid-fire manner.

  * When: Tuesday, June 21st, 2011 from 7:30-9:00 PM.
  * Where: frog – 101 West 6th Street – 2nd Floor
  * How: Parking is on the street, or you can take any number of buses to get downtown.
  * Afterwards, the discussion carries on a few blocks away at The Gingerman, where they have over 70 beers on tap.

Any questions or suggestions, please feel free to contact Joe (@joemccann). Also, be sure to follow us on Twitter: @AustinJS
