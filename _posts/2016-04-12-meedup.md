It's April, so let's shake off our collective SXSW hangovers üçª (or maybe emerge from our SXSW bunkers ‚ò¢Ô∏è) and get together on <x-date>{{ site.categories.meetups[0].when | date_to_xmlschema }}</x-date> for another great AustinJS!

We'll be hearing from <a href="{{ twiturl }}">{{ speakr }}</a> about <a href="http://elm-lang.org/">Elm</a>, a transpiled-to-JavaScript language which makes sure you‚Äôll never have a runtime error in your app. Almost. He'll cover why it‚Äôs cool, what it looks like, it‚Äôs pros and (most importantly) cons!
