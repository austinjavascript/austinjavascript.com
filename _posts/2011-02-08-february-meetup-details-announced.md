This month&#8217;s meetup we take a step away from the traditionally hardcore, engineering-focused styles talks and presentations and decide to focus back on the user interface and beautifying the web, specifically typography. Neighborhood superstar, Rails aficionado and iOS contemporary [Dave Rupert][1] will be discussing and showcasing, [Lettering.js][2].

Web type is exploding all over the web but CSS currently doesn&#8217;t offer complete down-to-the-letter control. While working on the <a href=""http://lostworldsfairs.com"">Lost World&#8217;s Fairs</a> project for Microsoft and the launch of IE9 Beta, Dave Rupert and team needed that level of control. Thus was born, Lettering.js, a jQuery plugin for radical web typography.

We&#8217;ll be walking through this simple jQuery plugin line-by-line, talking about the art of releasing a jQuery plugin, and peeking at some real-world use cases.

Dave Rupert is lead developer and 1/3rd of [Paravel][3]. He is also the host of the [ATX Web Show][4], a not-so-weekly podcast all about the local web design and development scene here in Austin, TX.

Of course we will followup his presentation with our wildly crowd-pleasing roundtable of JavaScript-related questions.  This is an open forum to present topics of discussion in a rapid-fire manner or simply heckle [@joemccann][5].

  * When: Tuesday, February 15th, 2011 from 7:30-9:00 PM.
  * Where: frog design – 101 West 6th Street – 2nd Floor
  * How: Parking is on the street, or you can take any number of buses to get downtown.
  * Drinks and pizza will be provided.

Afterwards, the discussion carries on a few blocks away at [The Gingerman][6], where they have over 70 beers on tap.

Any questions or suggestions, please feel free to contact Joe ([@joemccann][7]).  Also, be sure to follow us on Twitter: [@AustinJS][8]
