Post ACL weekend here in Austin, we will be having the last installment of Austin JS for 2012.  Sad Panda, indeed.  This month, we have another local JavaScript expert chatting up Windows 8!

Johnathan Hebert ([@johnathanhebert][1]) is the lead JavaScript developer for [Evernote][2] in Austin.  He spends his days writing [Skitch][3] for Windows 8 and browsers, and loves to learn all the latest and greatest stuff that can be done with JavaScript.

Jonathan&#8217;s talk will be about writing Windows Store Apps with JavaScript, including:

  * How to use the Windows Runtime from JavaScript
  *  The WinJS libraries
  * Async programming with promises
  * Re-using your Windows Store App code in a browser
  * Avoiding gotchas in the Windows Store App process

Of course we will followup all of this up with our wildly crowd-pleasing roundtable of JavaScript-related questions.  This is an open forum to present topics of discussion in a rapid-fire manner or simply heckle [@joemccann][4].  Oh wait!  He&#8217;s not gonna be there. Guess you&#8217;ll have to heckle guest host, [@slexaxton][5]!

  * When: Tuesday, October 16th, 2012 from 7:30-9:00 PM.
  * Where: frog design – 101 West 6th Street – 2nd Floor
  * How: Parking is on the street, or you can take any number of buses to get downtown.
  * Drinks and awesome pizza from [Home Slice][6] will be provided.

Afterwards, the discussion carries on a few blocks away at [The Gingerman][7], where they have over 70 beers on tap.  **We may even have some free rounds of beer courtesy of our awesome sponsors**.

Any questions or suggestions, please feel free to contact Joe ([@joemccann][8]).  Also, be sure to follow us on Twitter: [@AustinJS][9].
