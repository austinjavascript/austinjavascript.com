Since so many of us were devastated to find out that there was no meetup scheduled for December, TEKsystems decided to step up and allows us to drown our sorrows in a few pints of beer!

> TEKsystems would like to invite The Austin JavaScript User Group to our Christmas Cheer and Beer Happy Hour at The Ginger Man on December 21st.  We will have an open tab from 6 PM to 8 PM.  Please feel free to invite friends, colleagues, family (sorry no children).  Happy Holidays!!

So do your part and represent our strong and ever growing community (42 people at last month&#8217;s meetup!) at The Ginger Man on December 21st.

Happy Holidays!
