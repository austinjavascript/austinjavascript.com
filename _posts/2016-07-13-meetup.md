This Tuesday, <x-date>{{ site.categories.meetups[0].when | date_to_xmlschema }}</x-date>, discover how this one weird extension **_changed the web forever_**. Andrew Dupont will give us a 12 year perspective (most of a century in internet years) on the ways GreaseMonkey shaped today's browsers and how user scripts give us the opportunity of a better web.
