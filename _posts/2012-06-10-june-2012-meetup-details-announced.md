Coming in just on the heels of what is to be *the* JavaScript conference of the South, [TXJS][1], Austin JavaScript has brought another out-of-town guest speaker to the June 2012 meetup.

[Mikeal Rogers][2] is one of those developers who needs very little introduction.  Seriously.  He gave me no info to post about whom he is!  You may know him from his work at [Mozilla][3], on [CouchDB][4] and most recently [node][5] including one of the most widely used modules, [request][6].

Mikeal will be talking about node.  That&#8217;s all he told me.  I foresee a rather bizarre presentation nonetheless.  Word is it may involve Japanese cuisine.

Of course we will followup all of this up with our wildly crowd-pleasing roundtable of JavaScript-related questions.  This is an open forum to present topics of discussion in a rapid-fire manner or simply heckle [@joemccann][7].

  * When: Tuesday, June 19th, 2012 from 7:30-9:00 PM.
  * Where: frog design – 101 West 6th Street – 2nd Floor
  * How: Parking is on the street, or you can take any number of buses to get downtown.
  * Drinks and awesome pizza from [Home Slice][8] will be provided.

Afterwards, the discussion carries on a few blocks away at [The Gingerman][9], where they have over 70 beers on tap.  **We may even have some free rounds of beer courtesy of our awesome sponsors**.

Any questions or suggestions, please feel free to contact Joe ([@joemccann][10]).  Also, be sure to follow us on Twitter: [@AustinJS][11].
