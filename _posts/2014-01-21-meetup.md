Happy New Year, Austin JavaScriptorians! Hopefully you&#8217;re enjoying your 2014 SO MUCH you&#8217;ve already broken those pesky resolutions you made a couple of weeks ago.

We&#8217;re kicking the new year off with an exciting talk from our friends at PayPal called &#8220;Release the Kraken: A Story of Node.js in the Enterprise.&#8221; Jeff Harrell and Erik Toth will tell us how PayPal revitalized its tech stack by moving from Java, JSP, and proprietary solutions to a Node.js web application stack with [dust.js][1] templating. Developer agility was the primary motivation, but along the way they had to take on enterprise culture and teach people that JavaScript is no longer a &#8220;toy,&#8221; but a powerful tool to wield. We&#8217;ll also take a look at PayPal&#8217;s web app framework, [Kraken][2].
