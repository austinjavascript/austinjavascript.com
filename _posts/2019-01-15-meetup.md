Grid frameworks in CSS help keep a product, department, or even a whole company visually aligned.
However, they can be a struggle to maintain while satisfying different experiences’ needs.
Thankfully, scripting languages have a knack for keeping everything sane. By creating a
new open-source package that generates grid frameworks, we will cover:

* Abstracting design specs for reusable code
* Performance vs CSS browser support
* The flexibility of isomorphic JavaScript packages
