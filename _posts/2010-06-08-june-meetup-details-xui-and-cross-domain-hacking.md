Right on heels of [TXJS,][1] this month&#8217;s edition of the Austin JavaScript Meetup includes two speakers from TXJS, Joe McCann and Alex Sexton.

[Joe McCann][2] is a Senior Technologist at [frog design][3], the Principal Consultant of [subPrint Interactive,][4] and founder and curator of the Austin JavaScript meetup group. With professional work experience ranging from the music and fashion industries to Wall Street and the web, Joe’s current passion lies in creating decadent user experiences whether the targeted medium is the web, mobile applications, desktop software, or even a new medium altogether and the targeted device ranges a from mobile phone to an iPad or even a new, proprietary device altogether.

Joe will be discussing the slick mobile micro-framework, [XUI][5], which you can use to build out mobile websites or even mobile webapps where the targeted device is running a reasonable build of Webkit (namely iPhone, Android, and WebOS).  Popular libraries like jQuery are a bit large in size and contain loads of cross-browser code that is irrelevant in most mobile devices.  XUI is only 3kb and can provide you with a large enough toolkit to get almost any job done.  Joe will introduce the library and how you can start using it right now.

[Alex Sexton][6] is Labs Engineer at Austin&#8217;s own [Bazaarvoice][7], is a co-host of the infamous [yayQuery podcast][8] and a contributor to a number of open source projects, including XUI.

If you had to rank the best and worst moments of your JavaScript life, you&#8217;d probably rank reading &#8220;The Good Parts&#8221; up towards the top, and deep down at the bottom of the list would be the day that you found out that you couldn&#8217;t make cross-domain requests in the browser. This talk covers the hacks, tips, and tricks to leave the Same Origin Policy in the dust. So grab a cookie, pad your json, and learn how to communicate properly.

  * When: Tuesday, June 15th, 2010 from 7:30-9:00 PM.
  * Where: [Virtue Group][9] &#8212; [1206 W 43rd Street Austin TX 78756][10]
  * How: Parking is on the street, or you can take the #3 bus or #338 bus.

Afterwards, the discussion carries on one block away at [The Draught House][11], where it just happens to be **pint night** so you can get your beer fix here.

Any questions or suggestions, please feel free to contact Joe ([@joemccann][12]) or Kyle ([@getify][13]). Also, official group on twitter: [@AustinJS][14]
