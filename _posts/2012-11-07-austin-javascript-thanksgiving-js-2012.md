Since the timing of the Thanksgiving holidays sadly interrupts Austin JavaScript&#8217;s monthly meetup schedule, we decided to still get together instead of canceling the meetup entirely.

<a href="http://austinjavascript.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/thanksgiving.js-400x400.png" rel="lightbox[386]"><img class="size-full wp-image-389 alignnone" title="Thanksgiving.js" src="http://austinjavascript.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/thanksgiving.js-400x400.png" alt="Thanksgiving.js" width="400" height="400" /></a>

So come and join us for **free beer**, **free food** and an all around good time at our staple pub, [The Ginger Man][1].  This is purely a social event, but your JS skills may be tested so come prepared!

One of last month&#8217;s meetup sponsors, [Rapid 7][2], is our exclusive sponsor for this event so be sure to thank them and say hello!

Details:

  * What:  Thanksgiving.js 2o12!
  * Where:  [The Ginger Man, Austin, TX][3]
  * When:  Monday, November 19th from 7:00 PM til whenever we stop!
  * Who:  You!
  * Why:  Why not?

Any questions or suggestions, please feel free to contact Joe ([@joemccann][4]).
