We hope your summers were eventful and full of fun, but it&#8217;s time to get back into the groove. We&#8217;re happy to partner up with the [EmberATX meetup][1] for a meetup of the centuries. [Tom Dale][2], co-creator of [Ember.js][3] will be visiting Austin to give a talk about Ember.js, the state of Ember 1.0, and the future of the framework.

We&#8217;re expecting a pretty full-house and only have limited space, **so we ask that you RSVP here: [Meetup.com EmberATX/AustinJS RSVP][4]** (slackers note: it should be open up &#8217;til the moment the meetup starts, unless it fills up).

AustinJS would like to thank the EmberATX community for setting this up. We&#8217;re happy to share our space with other awesome JavaScript communities in town!

  * When: Tuesday, October 15th, 2013 from 7:30-9:00 PM.
  * Where: Frog Design – 101 West 6th Street – 2nd Floor
  * How: Parking is on the street, or you can take any number of buses to get downtown.
  * Drinks and pizza will be provided.

Afterwards, the discussion carries on a few blocks away at [The Gingerman][5], where they have over 70 beers on tap.

Any questions or suggestions, please feel free to contact Alex ([@SlexAxton][6]).  Also, be sure to follow us on Twitter: [@AustinJS][7]. You can contact the EmberATX folks at [@EmberATX][8].
