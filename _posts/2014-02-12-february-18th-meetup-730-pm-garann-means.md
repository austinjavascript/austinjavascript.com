This month we&#8217;ll be hearing from [Garann Means][1] about refactoring big apps! 

It would be nice if developers could download a JavaScript framework, plug in the custom logic required for their particular problem, and have a functional, scalable, and reliable application. As any who&#8217;s tried can probably tell you, however, it doesn&#8217;t work like that. It doesn&#8217;t matter if your application has 5000 &#8220;pages&#8221; or less than 50 &#8211; it will eventually become a large application in terms of code, because size of code is not just a measure of the complexity of the app itself, but of its maturity. If you&#8217;ve tried taking an app from a minimal set of functionality to something complex enough to cover all the edge cases, you&#8217;ve probably done some rewriting.

If you haven&#8217;t, it&#8217;s your lucky day! We&#8217;ll talk about several of the ways you can almost guarantee a rewrite in your app&#8217;s future. If, on the other hand, rewrites don&#8217;t sound like that much fun to you, we&#8217;ll also talk about how to avoid them or at least minimise the risk they present 

Garann is a JavaScript and front-end developer. She writes about web technologies and communities on [her own blog][2] as well as contributing articles to other technical publications, and is the author of &#8220;Node for Front-End Developers&#8221; from O&#8217;Reilly. She&#8217;s taught classes on many of the same topics she writes about, and sometimes organizes events for other developers. 

AustinJS is sponsored this month by [Mass Relevance][3], so if you enjoy a slice of pizza or a drink at the meetup then be sure to thank them. Better yet, if you&#8217;re a developer looking for a job, check out [careers at Mass Relevance][4] or chat with one of their engineers at the meetup.
