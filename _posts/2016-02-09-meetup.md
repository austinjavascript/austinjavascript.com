We'd like to thank [Spredfast][] for being gracious enough to host this month (make sure to not show up at Frog!). We've got food and beverages this month thanks to [Front End Development at IBM][] (FED@IBM). If you'd like to hear more about what they're working on, feel free to check out the [Feducation event they're doing with General Assembly][].
