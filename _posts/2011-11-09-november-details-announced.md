After an off month in October, we are back this month with another local giving a great talk on how to use web technologies to build native mobile applications with libraries such as Sencha Touch and Phonegap.

[Lyle Garza][1] is an Austin based JavaScript developer with a passion for web technologies.  He has extensive experience in social media, e-commerce, and mobile development.  For the last year, his primary passion has been bridging the gap between native mobile apps and mobile websites .

Lyle will be discussing the creation of native mobile apps using web technologies.  He&#8217;ll cover items from development to debugging and distribution of the app. To help demonstrate these concepts, he&#8217;ll be demoing a recent app that he created called [Dateventure][2].

Local healthcare software provider, [Tango Health][3] will be sponsoring as well so expect to fill your belly with pizza and drinks!

[Joe][4] is yet again still out of town so [Alex][5] will be guest hosting the meetup.

  * When: Tuesday, November 15th, 2011 from 7:30-9:00 PM.
  * Where: frog – 101 West 6th Street – 2nd Floor
  * How: Parking is on the street, or you can take any number of buses to get downtown.
  * Afterwards, the discussion carries on a few blocks away at [The Gingerman][6], where they have over 70 beers on tap.

Any questions or suggestions, please feel free to contact Joe ([@joemccann][4]) or Alex ([@slexaxton][5]). Also, be sure to follow us on Twitter: [@AustinJS][7]
