After a huge turnout last month (nearly 40 attendees), we are expecting even bigger and better things this coming month in our August meetup.  We are changing the format a bit with **one presentation**, by Mike McNally on web application design and coding strategies, followed by an **open forum of topics**.

Mike McNally ([@m5][1]) started his software career in the late &#8217;70s. He&#8217;s done a little of almost everything along the way: COBOL, image processing, real-time control systems, system software, multimedia, distributed system management, and financial web applications. Mike survived a couple of Austin corporate acquisitions before packing up his office knick-knacks and web app experience  for a new startup, Tango Health.

Mike will talk about web application design and coding strategies, and how the domains of  &#8221;active&#8221; page design, unobtrusive Javascript coding, and user experience architecture all collide to give us a great big headache. He&#8217;ll talk about a small jQuery plugin as an example of harnessing the power of your favorite framework for more than just rounded corners.  Check him out at <http://whatsthepointy.blogspot.com>.

After some great discussions during our last meetup (and even afterwards at The Gingerman), we decided to have an open forum discussing various topics at this month&#8217;s meetup.  Topics will be chosen at random, but please come to the meetup with some ideas or better yet, leave them in the comments or @ reply to [@austinjs][2] on twitter.

  * When: Tuesday, August 17th, 2010 from 7:30-9:00 PM.
  * Where: frog design – 101 West 6th Street – 2nd Floor
  * How: Parking is on the street, or you can take any number of buses to get downtown.

Afterwards, the discussion carries on a few blocks away at [The Gingerman][3], where they have over 70 beers on tap.

Any questions or suggestions, please feel free to contact Joe ([@joemccann][4]) or Kyle ([@getify][5]). Also, official group on twitter: [@AustinJS][6]
