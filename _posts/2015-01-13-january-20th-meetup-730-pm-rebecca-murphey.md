Hey happy New Year Austin! Let&#8217;s celebrate by getting together and talking about 3<sup>rd</sup> party JavaScript.

![aw snap third party js party][1]

So who&#8217;s gonna emcee this rager? None other than the venerable [Rebecca Murphey][2] ([@rmurphey][3]). Get ready to hear some harrowing-ass tales of running code on other people&#8217;s sites, from one of the largest 3<sup>rd</sup> party JavaScript deployments out there.

Rebecca Murphey is a staff software engineer at [Bazaarvoice][4], where she leads a team that shepherds third-party JavaScript application development across the organization. She is a frequent speaker on the topic of code organization and best practices at various JavaScript conferences, including Front-End Ops Conf, the 2014 jQuery Conference in San Diego, JSConf US 2013, JSConf US 2011, JSConf EU 2010, Full Frontal 2012, Fronteers 2012, and many others. She lives in Austin, TX, with her partner, their son, and their dog. She blogs at [rmurphey.com][2].

Drinks and eats are provided this month by [Amazon.com, Inc.][5] You may have heard of this Seattle based e-retailer, but you may *not* have heard that they&#8217;re hiring for positions at their Austin office! If the idea of working on [the world&#8217;s 6<sup>th</sup> largest website][6] is interesting to you, come talk to one of the Amazon folks at the meetup. You can also [apply online][7].

As always, thank you [Frog][8] for graciously hosting. You folks are great.

  * When: Tuesday, January 20<sup>th</sup>, 2015 from 7:30-9:00 PM.
  * Where: Frog Design – 101 West 6<sup>th</sup> Street – 2<sup>nd</sup> Floor
  * How: Parking is on the street, or you can bus, bike, rollerblade, segway, or walk yourself down there and just not worry about it.
  * Drinks and pizza will be provided.

Afterwards, the discussion carries on a few blocks away at [The Gingerman][9], where they have over 70 beers on tap. 

If you&#8217;ve got any questions or suggestions, feel free to contact Aaron ([@aaronj1335][10]).  Also, be sure to follow us on Twitter: [@AustinJS][11]
