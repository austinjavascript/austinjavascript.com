It may still be hot in ATX, but summer is [over][], so our very own [{{ speakr }}][] is gonna *take us back to school* and tell us about JavaScript in the Ivory Tower. We'll cover some great papers about JavaScript, and go beyond that to discuss how to find good research and read those super long intimidating papers.

    complicated things on the web.
