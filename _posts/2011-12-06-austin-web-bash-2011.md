It&#8217;s that time of year again where the various Austin meetup groups all get together and celebrate the Holidays with song and dance, err maybe it&#8217;s just some beers and food, yeah, beer and food!

That&#8217;s right on Tuesday, December 13th from 7pm to 9pm the greater Austin web community will have its annual holiday gala while also supporting a good cause:  The Capitol Area Food Bank.

There will be mingling and possibly mistletoe depending on the weather (naturally) and of course free food and beer provided by our gracious sponsors:
