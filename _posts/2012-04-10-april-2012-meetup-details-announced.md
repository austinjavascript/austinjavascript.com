After another [stellar SXSW event][1], Austin JS is back with another guest speaker, this time with [Ben Combee][2] of WebOS fame.

Ben&#8217;s a developer platform architect at HP&#8217;s webOS group. He been doing developer activities as part of the Palm & webOS world since leading the Codewarrior for Palm OS team at Metrowerks in the early 2000&#8242;s. He&#8217;s also worked at Mozilla in their mobile browser and done open source hardware hacking with NYC Resistor in Brooklyn.

Straightforward and to the point, Ben will be chatting with us on how to build web apps with [Enyo][3] and [Onyx][4].

Of course we will followup all of this up with our wildly crowd-pleasing roundtable of JavaScript-related questions.  This is an open forum to present topics of discussion in a rapid-fire manner or simply heckle [@joemccann][5].

  * When: Tuesday, April 17th, 2012 from 7:30-9:00 PM.
  * Where: frog design – 101 West 6th Street – 2nd Floor
  * How: Parking is on the street, or you can take any number of buses to get downtown.
  * Drinks and pizza will be provided.

Afterwards, the discussion carries on a few blocks away at [The Gingerman][6], where they have over 70 beers on tap.

Any questions or suggestions, please feel free to contact Joe ([@joemccann][7]).  Also, be sure to follow us on Twitter: [@AustinJS][8].
