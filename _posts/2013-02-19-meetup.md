February has enough days dedicated to love and romance, so we're dedicating our meetup to **bugs**. We've got local JavaScript free-thinker and theorist Lon Ingram joining us for a talk about bugs and bug reproduction (ewww gross).

Lon will discuss the problem of reproducing and diagnosing bugs reported from the wild, and then present Reanimator, an experimental system for capturing and replaying JavaScript applications. Reanimator captures non-deterministic input to a JavaScript application in a log that can replayed at a later date. It was originally designed for recording web application crashes for later debugging, but Lon will also cover other uses, such as usability testing and tutorials.

Of course we will followup all of this up with our wildly crowd-pleasing roundtable of JavaScript-related questions.  This is an open forum to present topics of discussion in a rapid-fire manner or simply heckle [@joemccann][1] or [@slexaxton][2]!

Any questions or suggestions, please feel free to contact Alex ([@SlexAxton][5]).  Also, be sure to follow us on Twitter: [@AustinJS][6].
