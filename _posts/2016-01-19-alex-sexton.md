&#127881;&#127878; Happy New Year &#127878;&#127881; Hopefully 2016 finds all of you well, and hopefully you'll ***RESOLLLLVVVVE*** to make it out to AustinJS next week to hear [Alex Sexton][] talk about "almost definitely client side security." We're pretty certain that means his three-hour deep dive on whether [Rey is a Kenobi][] (hey as long as it's not [politics][], [religion][], or [sex][] right).
