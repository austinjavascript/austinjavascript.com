Coming off last month&#8217;s meetup, we now have the first in our guest speakers series at Austin JavaScript plus another local giving his presentation from [JSConf EU][1] in Berlin.

[Brian Leroux][2], Lead at [Nitobi][3], co-author of [Phonegap][4], and creator of projects like [XUI][5] and [Lawnchair][6] and [wtfjs.com][7] will be flying in from Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada to talk to us about Phonegap, an open source development framework for building cross-platform mobile apps. Phonegap allows you to build apps in HTML and JavaScript and *still* take advantage of core features in iPhone/iTouch, iPad, Google Android, Palm, Symbian and Blackberry SDKs. Brian will be giving a talk on Phonegap, when you should and should not use it and also showcase the brand new app packaging in the cloud service at [build.phonegap.com][8].

[Joe McCann][9], Senior Technologist at [frog design][10] and Principal at [subPrint Interactive][11] will be giving his presentation on Rapid Prototyping with JavaScript for Multiple Platforms that he gave in Berlin at JSConf.Eu.  Read the comprehensive description of his talk [here][12] and go check out the source code for the apps for the demos on [github][13].

  * When: Tuesday, October 19th, 2010 from 7:30-9:00 PM.
  * Where: frog design – 101 West 6th Street – 2nd Floor
  * How: Parking is on the street, or you can take any number of buses to get downtown.
  * Drinks and pizza will be provided.

Afterwards, the discussion carries on a few blocks away at [The Gingerman][14], where they have over 70 beers on tap.
