Accessibility is hard. Oftentimes, it’s difficult to understand what users and
assistive technology expect from your markup and designs. Can accessibility be
easier to learn? Can it be&hellip;fun? In this talk, <a href="{{ twiturl }}">{{
speakr }}</a> will approach accessibility the way we might tackle a video

and modals; how to test them; and how to defeat them while leveling up your
skillset along the way.
