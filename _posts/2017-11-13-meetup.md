### DOCKER! CONTAINERS! KUBERNETES! GAAAAH!

If all that stuff is confusing or intimidating, don’t panic - we’re here to
help. We’ll help you develop a mental model of a kubernetes cluster and what it
does, then jump into a demo of how you’d build and deploy a simple javascript
application inside a kubernetes cluster. Don’t worry - if we were able to
figure this out, you can too.
