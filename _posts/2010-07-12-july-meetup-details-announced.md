The July meetup details consist of some client side and server side JavaScript discussions. Joe McCann will be providing some info on the ultra hot web server and web app framework Node.js while Andrew Dupont educates us on the latest and greatest features of scripty2.

Joe McCann is a Senior Technologist at [frog design][1], the Principal Consultant of [subPrint Interactive][2], and founder and curator of the Austin JavaScript meetup group. With professional work experience ranging from the music and fashion industries to Wall Street and the web, Joe’s current passion lies in creating decadent user experiences whether the targeted medium is the web, mobile applications, desktop software, or even a new medium altogether and the targeted device ranges a from mobile phone to an iPad or even a new, proprietary device altogether.

Joe will be introducing [Node.js][3], an [evented][4] [I/O][5] [framework][6] for the [V8 JavaScript engine][7].  Node.js is intended to be used to write scalable network programs such as web servers.  However, Node can also be used as a web app framework in addition to its use as a web server.  Joe will be showing some very high level uses of Node (Hello World), but also some more practical uses including the use of the [Express framework][8] and even an example of using [WebSockets][9] with Node.

Andrew Dupont is a web front-end developer and co-maintainer of [Prototype][10], the widely-used JavaScript framework. He is the author of *Practical Prototype & script.aculo.us*, published by Apress.

The long alpha period of [scripty2][11], the successor to [script.aculo.us][12], is nearing a close. Andrew will give a tour of the new scripty2 effects engine — complete with support for CSS transitions and hardware-accelerated animation — and show you the new UI components which boast full compatibility with jQuery UI themes.

  * When: Tuesday, July 20th, 2010 from 7:30-9:00 PM.
  * Where: frog design &#8211; 101 West 6th Street &#8211; 2nd Floor
  * How: Parking is on the street, or you can take any number of buses to get downtown.

Afterwards, the discussion carries on a few blocks away at [The Gingerman][13], where they have over 70 beers on tap.

Any questions or suggestions, please feel free to contact Joe ([@joemccann][14]) or Kyle ([@getify][15]). Also, official group on twitter: [@AustinJS][16]
