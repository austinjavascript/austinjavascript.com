After a massively successful SXSWi party last month, we are back on schedule for our monthly meetup.  This month, we have a presentation on how to use <a title="Adobe AIR" href="http://www.adobe.com/products/air/" target="_blank">Adobe AIR</a> to build desktop applications by Aaron Forsander.

<a title="Aaron Forsander on Twitter" href="http://twitter.com/AaronForsander" target="_blank">Aaron Forsander</a> is a web developer from Austin, TX.  He graduated from The University of Texas at Austin in 2008 with a degree in Electrical Engineering and, to the chagrin of his parents, immediately discarded it to build web applications.  He is currently a developer for Four Kitchens where he helps them make BIG websites.

### Building Desktop Applications Using Adobe AIR and JavaScript</strong>

As a JavaScript developer you don&#8217;t have to limit yourself to the web.  Adobe AIR allows web developers to create desktop applications with technologies they are familiar with including Flash, Flex and JavaScript. This talk demonstrates the basics on how to create desktop applications entirely in JavaScript.  I addition, I will also talk about helpful libraries and frameworks that allow you to develop rapidly, organize your code and unit test.  You can do more with Adobe AIR than just build Twitter clients, I promise!

  * When:  Tuesday, April 20th, 2010 from  7:30-9:30 PM.
  * Where:  [Virtue Group][1] &#8211;  [1206 W 43rd Street Austin TX 78756][2]
  * How:  Parking is on the street, or you can take the #3 bus or #338 bus.

Afterwards, the discussion carries on one block away at [The Draught House][3], where it just happens to be pint night so you can get your beer fix here.

Any questions or suggestions, please feel free to contact Joe ([@joemccann][4]) or Kyle ([@getify][5]).  Also, official group on twitter: [@AustinJS][6]
