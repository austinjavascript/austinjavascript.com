Happy New Year!  Now that most of us are back to work after a hopefully relaxing holiday, we are ready to kick off yet another year of solid JavaScript meetups for the Austin area.

This month we have a special guest flying in from New York City &#8211; the CTO and co-founder of [Nodejitsu][1], [Paolo Fragemeni][2].  Paolo, a solid computer programmer and veteran hacker has written loads of node.js code including the a significant portion dedicated to the node.js framework, [Flatiron][3].

Node.js.  What is it?!!  How does it work?!!  Paolo will be giving an informative talk on just that &#8211; the anatomy of node.js.  So whether you are are node.js newbie or a seasoned veteran, this informative talk on node will benefit you.

Also, we will be throwing the **3rd Annual Austin JS SXSW Party** in March so if you and/or your employer/company would like to sponsor the event (or be a part of it), please reach out to [@joemccann][4] to find out more details.

Of course we will followup all of this up with our wildly crowd-pleasing roundtable of JavaScript-related questions.  This is an open forum to present topics of discussion in a rapid-fire manner or simply heckle [@joemccann][4].

  * When: Tuesday, January 17th, 2012 from 7:30-9:00 PM.
  * Where: frog design – 101 West 6th Street – 2nd Floor
  * How: Parking is on the street, or you can take any number of buses to get downtown.
  * Drinks and pizza will be provided.

Afterwards, the discussion carries on a few blocks away at [The Gingerman][5], where they have over 70 beers on tap.

Any questions or suggestions, please feel free to contact Joe ([@joemccann][6]).  Also, be sure to follow us on Twitter: [@AustinJS][7].
