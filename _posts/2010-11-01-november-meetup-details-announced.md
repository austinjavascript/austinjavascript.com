After last month&#8217;s large turnout for the first in our guest speaker&#8217;s series, you may want to consider getting to this month&#8217;s meetup early.  Not only are we bringing back the roundtable discussion of various JavaScript topics, but we have the Reverend Pete Higgins flying in from Tennessee!

[Pete Higgins][1], aka the &#8220;It&#8217;s Just JavaScript Guy&#8221;, is the [Dojo Toolkit Project Lead][2] and also the creator of a new feature detection library, [has.js][3].  Every time you sniff a browser a baby kitten dies.  Never fear as Pete will be discussing the usage of has.js so many more kittens can live happy lives.  Also, Pete will be chatting up the Dojo Foundation and a brand new CommonJSBrowser Initiative (details at the meetup!).  Follow Pete on twitter at [@phiggins][1] and be sure to have a look at his campaign at <http://higginsforpresident.net>.

For the second half of the meetup we will carry on with our new tradition of the open forum where you, yes you and everyone else will have an opportunity to ask a question, bring up a topic or heckle [@joemccann][4].  Our latest polls indicate many people enjoy the roundtable discussion so be sure to have some fresh ideas!

  * When: Tuesday, November 16th, 2010 from 7:30-9:00 PM.
  * Where: frog design – 101 West 6th Street – 2nd Floor
  * How: Parking is on the street, or you can take any number of buses to get downtown.
  * Drinks and pizza will be provided.

Afterwards, the discussion carries on a few blocks away at [The Gingerman][5], where they have over 70 beers on tap.

Any questions or suggestions, please feel free to contact Joe ([@joemccann][6]) or Kyle ([@getify][7]). Also, official group on twitter: [@AustinJS][8]
