Let's kick off the new year with [Bradley Farias](https://github.com/bmeck), who
will deliver a meditation on the seven stages of ~~grief~~ standards
development:

### From Language Design to TC39 (The JS Language Standards Group)

This talk is a reflection on a lot of discussions that come up when talking
about language design and what it means to design for a future that is always
bigger than the past. Topics from the past present and future such as ASI, ESM,
decorators, and private fields are things that are important to get right if we
are stuck with them forever. We can use discussion examples of each of these
topics to get a better understanding of why it is so difficult to make things
"just work". I will discuss ongoing themes of discussion within TC39 and efforts
that are changing how TC39 is viewed.
