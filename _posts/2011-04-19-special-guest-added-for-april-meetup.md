Last minute special guests are always welcome at the Austin JavaScript Meetup and this month, we have an extra special guest from the [Mozilla][1] team: [David Herman][2].

[David Herman][3] is a programming language propeller-head at Mozilla, where he works on the design of next-generation languages and language features. He&#8217;s am a member of [Ecma TC39][4], the committee designing future versions of the JavaScript language standard. The Ecma committee is hard at work on the design of the next version of JavaScript. David will present some highlights of the cool features we can expect in the future of JavaScript.

Of course we still have everything in store for you as previously planned, but now with some [lagniappe][5]!
