README: >
  as soon as we know the date for the next meetup, `cp _drafts/meetup.md
  _posts/YYYY-MM-DD-meetup.md`, remove this README, and add a `when` property
  to this section. the front page will update to let folks know that we've got
  something in the works. THE FILE NAME DATE CANNOT BE IN THE FUTURE. idk
  that's just how jekyll works.
