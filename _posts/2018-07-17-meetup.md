### Zelda + a11y?

Accessibility is hard. Oftentimes, it’s difficult to understand what users and
assistive technology expect from your markup and designs. Can accessibility be
easier to learn? Can it be…fun? In this talk, <a href="{{ twiturl }}">{{ speakr
}}</a> will approach accessibility the way we might tackle a video game—looking
at a handful of common UI patterns like popup, tabs, accordions, and modals; how
to test them; and how to defeat them while leveling up your skillset along the
way.
