What up Austonians, it&#8217;s Austin JS time again! Come join us at Spredfast (formerly Mass Relevance, ***note the location change***) for another meetup. We&#8217;ll hear from local web builder [Jared Stilwell][1] about &#8220;Complexity Metrics and You.&#8221; What are complexity metrics? Great question!

The code works. Your linter and test cases are happy. But, you feel the code could be cleaner. Where do you start? Complexity metrics can lead the way. Using a combination of measurement techniques, the process of finding rough edges in your codebase and tracking improvements becomes much easier. We&#8217;ll cover several common metrics, the landscape of existing tools for JavaScript, and how they can be used to guide refactoring.

Tonight our sponsor is an awesome startup from right here in Austin. [HuBoard][2] gives you instant project management built right on top of what you&#8217;re already using for your project, GitHub. Check out their app online, and make sure to tell them thanks for covering the pizza and drinks this month!

  * When: Tuesday, June 17<sup>th</sup>, 2014 from 7:30-9:30 PM.
  * Where: Spredfast (formerly Mass Relevance) – [8<sup>th</sup> and Brazos][4] – through the 8<sup>th</sup> street entrance and to the right
  * How: Parking is on the street, or you can bus, bike, rollerblade, segway, or walk yourself down there and just not worry about it.

Afterwards, the discussion carries on a few blocks away at [The Gingerman][5], where they have over 70 beers on tap.
