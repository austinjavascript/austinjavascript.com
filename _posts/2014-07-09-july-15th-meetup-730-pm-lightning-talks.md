Hey Austin Javascripters, this month&#8217;s meetup is gonna bring that `~*~* variety *~*~`. Here are a few talks that we&#8217;ve got lined up already:

  * [@lawnsea][1]: TCP Trix
  * [@kassandra_perch][2]: NodeBots
  * [@elbenshira][3]: ClojureScript and Om
  * [@WebDesserts][4]: chroma.js and color manipulation
  * [@ClassicallyGeek][5] and [@pncifra][6]: Google Polymer and Web Components
  * maybe [@aaronj1335][7] if there&#8217;s time: If Underscore Was Written in ES6

We&#8217;ve still got some time though, so feel free to come with an idea, and we&#8217;ll work everyone in!

We&#8217;re back at our normal spot, Frog Design.

Big thanks to our sponsors this month, [The Bidding Network][8], a top-flight staffing firm based right here in Austin. If you enjoy the pizza and drinks, make sure to tell them thanks. And of course, if you&#8217;re looking for a job you should [talk to them][9]. You won&#8217;t find a better recruiter in Austin!

  * When: Tuesday, July 15<sup>th</sup>, 2014 from 7:30-9:30 PM.
  * Where: Frog Design – 101 West 6th Street – 2nd Floor
  * How: Parking is on the street, or you can bus, bike, rollerblade, segway, or walk yourself down there and just not worry about it.
  * Drinks and pizza will be provided.

Afterwards, the discussion carries on a few blocks away at [The Gingerman][10], where they have over 70 beers on tap. 

If you&#8217;ve got any questions or suggestions, feel free to contact Aaron ([@aaronj1335][11]).  Also, be sure to follow us on Twitter: [@AustinJS][12]
