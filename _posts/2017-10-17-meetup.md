Synthesizers! JavaScript! Aleatoricism?? Using an actual analog synthesizer as a guide, Kyle will build a feature-for-feature replica in the browser with the Web Audio API and show how to use JavaScript to overcome a lack of musical training. You'll learn the capabilities and limitations of the Web Audio API, and how it can be used for applications like gaming, WebVR, and 80s retro synthwave. With live coding, live synth playing, and a touch of music theory, <em>what could go wrong?</em>
