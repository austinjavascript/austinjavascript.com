Source maps, huh, yeah. What are they good for? Absolutely... some things.

We have an extra special treat this month thanks to our gracious hosts and good friends at Spredfast: Ben Vinegar is coming all the way from "San Francisco" to tell us everything about how source maps work. Join us Tuesday {{ when | fullDate }} for a special Bae Area AustinJS!

## Talk summary

You may already be familiar with source maps. They let you debug your original, unminified, and untranspiled code in the browser. But have you ever wondered how they actually work? Ben will take a deep dive into the source map format to see what’s under the hood, exploring source map generation tools, parsers, and how to manipulate source maps directly for fun and profit.
