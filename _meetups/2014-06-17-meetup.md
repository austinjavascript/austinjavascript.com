What up Austonians, it's Austin JS time again! Come join us at Spredfast (formerly Mass Relevance, **_note the location change_**) for another meetup. We'll hear from local web builder [Jared Stilwell][1] about "Complexity Metrics and You." What are complexity metrics? Great question!

The code works. Your linter and test cases are happy. But, you feel the code could be cleaner. Where do you start? Complexity metrics can lead the way. Using a combination of measurement techniques, the process of finding rough edges in your codebase and tracking improvements becomes much easier. We'll cover several common metrics, the landscape of existing tools for JavaScript, and how they can be used to guide refactoring.
