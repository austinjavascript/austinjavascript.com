Additionally, Effect provides mechanisms for retrying queries and managing interruptions, ensuring that your application remains resilient in various scenarios. Finally, its observability features help you monitor and debug your application more effectively. Now, you can take your todo application to the next level and impress everyone with your overengineered masterpiece.
