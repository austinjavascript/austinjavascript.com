Passwords are vulnerable and frustrating for users. Passkeys promise a seamless and secure authentication future. But understanding the concepts and implementing them into your web application can feel daunting.

In this talk, we'll break down the fundamentals of passkeys, including the WebAuthn specification and the benefits they provide. You'll learn how to set up a simple WebAuthn server, handle registration and authentication flows, and navigate the practical aspects of implementing passkeys in your application. We will cover just enough ground for you to get started and lay out a passkey foundation to be built upon.
