Or: "How a Rails developer read the docs, achieved enlightenment, and learned to love React server components"

It would be an exploration of the pain and oddities of how traditional web frameworks attempt to handle high-interactivity dynamic uis and how modern front end frameworks similarly handle low-interactivity static content pages.

Little bit of history-of-the-web, different live coding examples, some educational content around server components. Maybe even talk about Elixer/Phoenix, time allowing.
