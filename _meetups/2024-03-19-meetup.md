We’ve all heard of the React motto “write once, run everywhere” but what does this look like in reality? Learn how Expo Router––the universal React framework––is making it possible to reuse complex app development patterns like routing, data fetching, and rendering, across web and native platforms.

I’m the creator of Expo Router, and manage the dev tools/web team at Expo. Bring your most complicated React/React Native questions and I’ll try my best to answer them all.
