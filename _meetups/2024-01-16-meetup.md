Remix is a full stack web framework that lets you focus on the user interface and work back through web standards to deliver a fast, slick, and resilient user experience. In this talk Brooks will show you how Remix makes it easy to iteratively build solid, engaging, and user-centric experiences using the basic building blocks of the web.
