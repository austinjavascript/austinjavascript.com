Webster's Dictionary [defines "extravaganza" as][extravaganza]:

> a very large and exciting show or event

And nothing says exciting like JavaScript frameworksssssss!

<div class="sponsor-logo">
  <div class="hidden">
    <img src="https://cldup.com/G5ajKtTSq6.gif" style="width: 300px; max-width: 100%;" alt="WHOA REACT JS" />
    <button type="button" onclick="hideImage()" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto; line-height: 1.25rem; padding: .5rem 1rem; -webkit-appearance: none; border: 1px solid transparent; border-radius: 3px; background-color: #bbb;">
      WHOA MY EYES HIDE THAT THING
    </button>
  </div>

  <script>
  (function() {
    var theNoise = document.currentScript.parentElement.children[0];

    if (!window.localStorage.september2015HideGif)
      theNoise.className = '';

    window.hideImage = function() {
      theNoise.className = 'hidden';
      window.localStorage.september2015HideGif = 'for the love of everything yes';
    };
  })();
  </script>
</div>

Ok, calm down for a second so I can tell you what's going on here. [Tim Tyrrell][] and [Travis Swicegood][] are going to tell us about ReactJS, Flux, and that sort of stuff. Tim will kick it off live-coding with React, and then Travis will give a whirlwind tour of Flux and how it fits into the ecosystem we all love.

We won't dive too deep since we haven't covered React at AustinJS yet, but stay tuned for news about a new meetup you might be into!
