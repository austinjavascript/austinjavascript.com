Hosted software as a service is great, but can give the provider too much leverage over your data and the software itself. Meanwhile, self-hosted software, like many open source solutions, takes away the key value proposition of SaaS. Luckily, "semi-hosted" is a model that provides the best of both worlds and enables customization and extensibility not usually possible. I want to talk about this pattern and show what you can do with it by demonstrating a semi-hosted personal organizer I've been building with Deno and Mithril.js called Treestar.
