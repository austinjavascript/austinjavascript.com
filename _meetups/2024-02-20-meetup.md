Command palettes in applications are great â€” they spare us from reaching for the mouse to go spelunking through menus. Raycast and Script Kit are two delightful tools that are akin to command palettes, accessible from within any application, and programmable with JavaScript! Come, see what's possible, and feel empowered to start building out your own OS command palette!
