After a massively successful SXSWi party last month, we are back on schedule for our monthly meetup.  This month, we have a presentation on how to use <a title="Adobe AIR" href="http://www.adobe.com/products/air/" target="_blank">Adobe AIR</a> to build desktop applications by Aaron Forsander.

## Building Desktop Applications Using Adobe AIR and JavaScript

As a JavaScript developer you don't have to limit yourself to the web.  Adobe AIR allows web developers to create desktop applications with technologies they are familiar with including Flash, Flex and JavaScript. This talk demonstrates the basics on how to create desktop applications entirely in JavaScript.  I addition, I will also talk about helpful libraries and frameworks that allow you to develop rapidly, organize your code and unit test. You can do more with Adobe AIR than just build Twitter clients, I promise!
