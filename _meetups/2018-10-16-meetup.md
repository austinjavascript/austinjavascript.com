Handling events like clicks and keypresses as users interact with your content is essential for any web app. Learn the fundamentals of how events work in JavaScript, including:

* an introduction to the DOM Event specification
* how to attach event listeners (there's so many ways!)
* how event propagation works, what "bubbling" and "capturing" mean, and why you should care
* the differences between preventDefault, stopPropagation, and return false (and when you should use each one!)

Whether you're just learning JavaScript or are an experienced front-end developer, you'll walk away with a deeper familiarity with events. You'll be able to implement event listeners with confidence and debug with clarity!

This talk is adapted from an Ember.js-specific talk, [Deep Dive on Ember Events](http://mariechatfield.com/talks/#deep-dive-on-ember-events).
