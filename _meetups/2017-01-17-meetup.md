Happy New Year everyone! Here's to fresh start. We're kicking the year off in style with a great talk from Rachel Weil!

Rachel will share a selection of personal projects that bring vintage electronics into the 21<sup>st</sup> century with Node.js and hobbyist microcontrollers. She’ll also cover some of the basic tools and approaches to getting started with refurbishing, refitting, and reworking old game consoles, computers, and digital toys.

In other big news, Spredfast is now the official location for AustinJS! The Spredfast team has always been kind to share their `~*luxurious*~` downtown space with us, so we look forward to making more memories going forward. Thanks Spredfast!
