After last month's large turnout for the first in our guest speaker's series, you may want to consider getting to this month's meetup early.  Not only are we bringing back the roundtable discussion of various JavaScript topics, but we have the Reverend Pete Higgins flying in from Tennessee!

Every time you sniff a browser a baby kitten dies.  Never fear as Pete will be discussing the usage of has.js so many more kittens can live happy lives.  Also, Pete will be chatting up the Dojo Foundation and a brand new CommonJSBrowser Initiative (details at the meetup!).  Follow Pete on twitter at [@phiggins][1] and be sure to have a look at his campaign at <http://higginsforpresident.net>.

For the second half of the meetup we will carry on with our new tradition of the open forum where you, yes you and everyone else will have an opportunity to ask a question, bring up a topic or heckle [@joemccann][4].  Our latest polls indicate many people enjoy the roundtable discussion so be sure to have some fresh ideas!
