    bio: Kyle Simpson is a UI architect from Austin, TX. He is passionate about user experience, specifically optimizing the UI to be as responsive, efficient, secure, and scalable as possible. He considers JavaScript the ultimate language and is constantly tinkering with how to push it further. If something can't be done in JavaScript or web technology, he's bored by it. He has a number of open-source projects, including LABjs, HandlebarJS/BikechainJS, and flXHR, and he also is a core contributor to SWFObject.  Check him out at [Getify](http://blog.getify.com).

After another huge turnout in August, we are expecting yet another great meetup for September.  We have an Austin JavaScript veteran, [Kyle Simpson][1], giving a special presentation and we will follow it up with the **open forum of topics**.  So come prepared with ideas for discussion!

Kyle's discussion will be diving deep into the internals of how objects, constructors, and prototypes work. He will also cover many of the important upcoming ES5 changes which are starting to be implemented by the bleeding edge browsers.
