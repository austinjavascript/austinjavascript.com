Ever wanted to build something just for the vibes? In this talk, I’ll walk through how I prototyped a Tamagotchi-style app using Next.js and TailwindCSS — not for a client, not for a launch, but just to explore joy in coding. We'll cover core frontend logic (state management, time-based updates), CSS animations, and light gamification. The goal isn’t perfection — it's flow, play, and remembering why we started coding in the first place. Expect code demos, a few laughs, and maybe even a virtual pet revival.
