The holiday party was a blast! We introduced our new Austin JavaScript shirts for the first time, and gave them to the winning table members of the Web Trivia game we played. Plus, some tried out our new battledecks, where each speaker improvised the topic and content based on what slides popped up on the screen. They all did great, and were awarded a shirt as well.
